Welcome to my personal website. It's main purpose is to serve as a blog but will likely contain miscellaneous technology related stuff. It's likely a lot of the content here will have spelling errors, I just don't really care enough to fix them. If that bothers you, I'd recommend closing your browser tab and never visiting here again.
