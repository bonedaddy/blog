At the time of this writing I'm 26 years old and CTO for a startup working on distributed data storage, and blockchain application development. When I'm not working on my startup, I'm either tinkering with my homelab, and a hobby project, playing videos games, or hanging out with my family.

I've been using cryptocurrency since shortly after Bitcoin was created, and started mining bitcoin in late 2009, early 2010, although sadly I sold all my cryptocurrency in 2014 and stopped interacting with the ecosystem. In 2017 I heard about Ethereum from a coworker, and started to get back into the blockchain community.

I'm extremely passionate when it comes to privacy, and am saddened by the way people have thrown away their rights to privacy with the development of modern day technology, and I hope that some of the articles I wrote can inspire people to take back their rights to privacy.
