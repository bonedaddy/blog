When I first started developing with IPFS three years ago, I was extremely bullish on the long-term prospects on IPFS, and seriously viewed it as a contender for replacing, or supplementing HTTP. Had you told me then that IPFS was just another P2P network like Zeronet, or Freenet, I would've laughed and brushed you off as crazy. I would probably rationalized that by pointing out how active the community is, how the developers have already done a lot of work; Talk about the powers of content addressing and the benefits of data integrity, and data integrity verification. In fact, you didn't even need me to say these things, just go to [their website](https://ipfs.io) and the benefits of IPFS are laid out clear as day:

There's also a number of other things that IPFS lets you do; Including built-in Publish/Subscribe Messaging, a cryptographic naming system using a hash of public keys as the identifier, along with a neat data format called InterPlanetary Linked Data, or IPLD for short. When you consider the benefits mentioned in the previous image, along with the additional functionality of naming things, linked data structures, and pubsub messaging, you begin to get a package that, which Protocol Labs likes to say about IPFS, can replace the outdated and legacy HTTP that the modern day Internet so despearately depends on. I also used to echo that statement, and when I first started out entirely believed that IPFS will replace the current Internet. Three years later though, I no longer think that is the case. I think IPFS has become, and will never escape the label of "just another P2P network like Zeronet or Freenet".
