When I first started developing with IPFS three years ago, I was extremely bullish on the long-term prospects on IPFS, and seriously viewed it as a contender for replacing, or supplementing HTTP. Had you told me then that IPFS was just another P2P network like Zeronet, or Freenet, I would've laughed and brushed you off as crazy. 

I would probably rationalized that by pointing out how active the community is, how the developers have already done a lot of work; Talk about the powers of content addressing and the benefits of data integrity, and data integrity verification.  In fact, you didn't even need me to say these things, just go to [their website](https://ipfs.io) and the benefits of IPFS are laid out clear as day:

There's also a number of other things that IPFS lets you do; Including built-in Publish/Subscribe Messaging, a cryptographic naming system using a hash of public keys as the identifier, along with a neat data format called InterPlanetary Linked Data, or IPLD for short. When you consider these benefits, you begin to get a package that, as Protocol Labs likes to say, can replace the outdated and legacy HTTP that the modern day depends on.

Back when I first started with IPFS three years ago, I used to believe this, but as time went on on and I've spent thousands of hours working with IPFS, I've lost this belief. There's a number of issues with IPFS that are large in scope, and design decisions that prove to be problematic at scale. The issues which I'll go into shortly, are by no means unfixable, but based on the current, and past state of affairs when it comes to IPFS development, I think it is unlikely that they will be fixed.
