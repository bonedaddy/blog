This article kicks off a series of posts about why I'm no longer bullish on IPFS becoming mainstream, and reaching its stated goals of replacing HTTP. In this post I'll be giving a brief overview of my current opinion about IPFS, along with what I think IPFS will become.

# Overview

When I first started developing with IPFS three years ago, I was extremely bullish on the long-term prospects on IPFS, and seriously viewed it as a contender for replacing, or supplementing HTTP. Had you told me then that IPFS was just another P2P network like Zeronet, or Freenet, I would've laughed and brushed you off as crazy. 

I would probably rationalized that by pointing out how active the community is, how the developers have already done a lot of work; Talk about the powers of content addressing and the benefits of data integrity, and data integrity verification.  In fact, you didn't even need me to say these things, just go to [their website](https://ipfs.io) and the benefits of IPFS are laid out clear as day:

There's also a number of other things that IPFS lets you do; Including built-in Publish/Subscribe Messaging, a cryptographic naming system using a hash of public keys as the identifier, along with a neat data format called InterPlanetary Linked Data, or IPLD for short. When you consider these benefits, you begin to get a package that, as Protocol Labs likes to say, can replace the outdated and legacy HTTP that the modern day depends on.

Back when I first started with IPFS three years ago, I used to believe this, but as time went on on and I've spent thousands of hours working with IPFS, I've lost this belief. There's a number of issues with IPFS that are large in scope, and design decisions that prove to be problematic at scale. The issues which I'll go into shortly, are by no means unfixable, but based on the current, and past state of affairs when it comes to IPFS development, I think it is unlikely that they will be fixed.

# What Will IPFS Become

Before going into the issues, I'll start by talking about will become. The entire IPFS network I think will become another P2P network like Zeronet or Freenet but slightly more popular. It will have users, people will build things that use the network, but it wont become the new HTTP, or a massively popular network like the modern day Internet. At the end of the day IPFS is simply too impractical, and too heavy for everyone to use. It requires additional resources that aren't required to open up a web browser and look at your favourite memes, or read the news. It will never get to a point where technically illiterate people that can use web browsers, and use facebook, will be able to use IPFS.

There's a number of great things within the package of IPFS, such as the LibP2P library which is a P2P networking stack, self-describing hashes, amongst other subsystems of IPFS that I think will reach mainstream usage in a sense. They will likely never be used by everyone who uses the Interne, instead they will be used in the background by various other technologies that end-users interact with indirectly. 

In short, 10 years from now I think most people will have forgotten about IPFS, while the network continues to exist in the same vein that Zeronet or Freenet continue to exist. The technologies created by the creation of IPFS will in one form or another be used by other technologies, but as has been seen to date IPFS is far to impractical, and the development of it too chaotic for it to ever become the next HTTP.
