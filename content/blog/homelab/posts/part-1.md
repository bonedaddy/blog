When I was in college for computer systems administration, one of the my instructors mentioned that the best way to become familiar with technology, and be a proficient systems administrator, was having a homelab. The homelab allows you to get your hands dirty with real technology in ways similar to on the job experience, but without any pressure about taking down a mission critical system. It's also a great environment for trying out new technologies, and staying up to date on existing ones. Another benefit to the homelab that I dont think people talk about much, is it provides an opportunity for you to relieve yourself of dependency on cloud services, and enhance your privacy by using self-hostable versions of common cloud based applications.

There's a misconception that running a homelab is expensive since it usually means getting access to servers, enterprise networking equipment, etc... Thankfully unless you want to get the latest and greatest in enterprise hardware, you can actually pick up hardware pretty cheap second-hand. Websites like [craigslist](https://craigslist.org), [servermonkey](https://www.servermonkey.com/), and [labgopher](https://labgopher.com/) can all be used to get great second-hand hardware on a budget. The first server I ever got for my homelab was a tower purchased off craigslist for $200 CAD, packed with a hardware RAID card, 6TB of storage, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and an 4-core xeon processor.
