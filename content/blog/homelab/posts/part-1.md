When I was in college for computer systems administration, one of the my instructors mentioned that the best way to become familiar with technology, and be a proficient systems administrator, was having a homelab. The homelab allows you to get your hands dirty with real technology in ways similar to on the job experience, but without any pressure about taking down a mission critical system. It's also a great environment for trying out new technologies, and staying up to date on existing ones. Another benefit to the homelab that I dont think people talk about much, is it provides an opportunity for you to relieve yourself of dependency on cloud services, and enhance your privacy by using self-hostable versions of common cloud based applications.
