# Overview

I'm a proficient software engineer with a diverse technical background that allows me to play multiple roles efficiently, and practically. I prefer working as a backend engineer, but am more than adept when it comes to DevOps, or systems administration tasks. I can quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar environments, and view documentation writing as an essential part of the software development lifecycle. [You can find a large collection of my work on GitHub](https://github.com/bonedaddy)

# Programming Languages

The following table lists the programming/scripting languages I know, as well as my proficiency in them. I prefer working with Golang, as I find it's one of the best languages for writing efficienct and powerful software with very little overhead. I can pick up new languages quickly, but prefer to stick with ones that I'm fluent in.

| Language | Proficiency |
|----------|-------------|
| Golang   | Fluent      |
| Solidity | Fluent      |
| Bash     | Fluent      |
| C        | Beginner    |
| Python   | Basic       |
| JavaScript | Basic     |
| TypeScript | Basic     |
| C++        | Basic     |
