# Overview

I'm a proficient software engineer with a diverse technical background that allows me to play multiple roles efficiently, and practically. I prefer working as a backend engineer, but am more than adept when it comes to DevOps, or systems administration tasks. I can quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar environments, and view documentation writing as an essential part of softare development.
